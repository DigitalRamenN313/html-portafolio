<h2>Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ghost in the Shell(1995)</h3>
<p>One of the best sci-fi anime movies of the 90s.</p>
<h3>Watchmen</h3>
<p>In my opinion this is one, if not the best superhero movie ever made.</p>
<h3>The Thing(1982)</h3>
<p>This is one of the best movies from the director John Carpenter, has great actors and an amazing example of how to use practicar FX.</p>
